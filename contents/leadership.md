Our mission is understanding and improving mental health. I lead distributed collaborations through integrity and honest communication. We solve problems through creativity and perseverance.  

## Vision

An integrated understanding of mental illness that incoproates neurobiological insights while respecting the uniquely personal and subjective experience of these symptoms.  

## Core Values and Principles

- Honesty: We can't move forward if we're not standing on firm ground. We have to be honest with ourselves and with each other about what our evidence supports.  
*Ask questions fearlessly. Always admit mistakes.*   

- Communication: Open communication [stops most problems before they start](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills).  
*More communication is better than less.*  

- Integrity: Take responsibility for your commitments. Communicate honestly if you need help or if your timeline changes.  
*Show that you value your collaborators by making yourself available, but remember to value yourself as well.*

- Collaboration: Our whole community is all on the same team; we should all be pulling together.  
*Leave things better than you found them (give feedback, submit bug reports and pull requests).*

## Working with me

I'm a capable individual contributor and I will always do the best work I can. Sometimes this means I miss opportunities to delegate tasks that would otherwise be great growth opportunities. Other times this means we'll need to push had to meet a deadline. We'll communicate honestly about learning goals and project timelines, and keep communicating to adapt as things change.  

I really do value feedback and communication. I want to get better at this. If there's a specific instance when I could have been a better leader, or a general observation about how I could improve. [Please let me know](mailto:Dylan.Nielson@gmail.com).
