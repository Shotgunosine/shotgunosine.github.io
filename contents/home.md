#### Research Interests

My research centers on the intersection of machine learning, neuroimaging, and psychiatry, with a focus on improving the clinical relevance of computational tools in mental health. I am is particularly interested in aligning psychiatric constructs with patient experiences and developing personalized, data-driven approaches to understand adolescent depression, mood dynamics, and reward processing. My work leverages advanced neuroimaging techniques (fMRI, MEG), longitudinal data analysis, and open-source tool development to study brain-behavior relationships and support reproducible science. I also contributes to methodological innovations in quality control, scanner harmonization, and the application of large language models to psychiatric research.
